# Room-Expense-Management-System
##Project Name: Room Expense Management System
#Description:
The Room Expense Management System is a web-based application built using Django, designed to help users easily manage shared expenses in a roommate setup. It provides an efficient way to calculate each member's share of common expenses like food, utilities (electricity, water, WiFi, etc.), and additional costs. The application allows for meal-based expense tracking, enabling roommates to enter the number of meals they consume and calculating their share of the total expenses accordingly.

Expense Tracking: Calculate expenses based on meals and other shared utilities.
Meal-based Billing: Automatically calculate meal costs based on individual meal consumption.
Utility Expense Sharing: Divide shared costs like electricity, water, WiFi, and dustbin charges among all members.
Real-time Calculations: Provides each member with the amount they need to pay or can receive based on expenses and individual contributions.
User-friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive web UI for easy input and calculations.

#Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Django templates
Backend: Django (Python)
Database: SQLite (default Django database)
Other Tools: Bootstrap for responsive design
